# Learning SpringBoot - In 3 Weeks

My fork of the repository accompanying this [event](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/hands-on-spring-boot-in-3-weeks/0636920061597/0636920088326/).

While (these days) Java is not my primary language, nor is Spring Boot my technology of choice, I'd like to test out what others are using and refresh my skills from the past :-).

_This project is my scratchpad, not intended to be used by someone else, nor is it based on any particular best practices. In fact, it is **my own playground** and should be treated as such :-)... You have been warned._
